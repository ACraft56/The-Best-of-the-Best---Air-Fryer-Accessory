# The-Best-of-the-Best---Air-Fryer-Accessory 
There is no doubt about it, air fryers have become very popular in kitchens worldwide, and along with that, air fryers have become very popular in a very short span of time. 
They’re literally sweeping the nation! 
But how would you define an air fryer? 
And how do they work?
The popular air fryer is fundamentally an amplified oven that fits right on your countertop. 
Traditionally, when we talk about frying, we immediately focus our attention on the different types of oils to induce frying. 
But the air fryer does not use any types of oils, which makes it healthier. 
The air fryer doesn’t exactly fry your food, neither does it bake your food. 
Your air fryer is smartly constructed to simulate the results of deep-frying with nothing more than hot air. 
At this point today, air fryers are used in approximately forty percent of the kitchens around the United States. 
These were the results of a study conducted in July of 2020. 
Air fryers are used to cook a variety of foods including frozen chicken, baked cookies, French fries, vegetables and much, much more.
The condensed air that cooks your food comes from the top portion of the air fryer, and the food is placed in the bottom tray of the air fryer. 
The rapid circulation of hot air cooks your food to a crisp. 
The beauty of the air fryer is destroyed because families are content with using aluminum foil as a cooking tray. 
Well! That’s why I’m here! 
Air fryers are not going anywhere anytime soon, so it suits you to obtain the accessories that give your product class. 
I want to introduce the Silicone Baking Tray Mat Air Fryer Rest Kitchen Tools. 
This handsome designed tray is designed to cook food in your fryer at its hottest degree, and it is very easy to clean.
                                         
Many people will make the argument that air fried food is not good for you. 
That’s because they’re accustomed to cooking with grease. 
The mere fact that air fried food uses less to no oil, it is indeed healthier than even deep-fried foods. 
Frozen French fries prepared in the air fryer contains between 4 and 6 grams of fat, while cooking frozen French fries in a deep fryer carries a whopping 17 grams of 
fat. SO, YOU DO THE MATH!
So, if you don’t have an air fryer in your home, maybe you should consider the health factors of cooking without grease or oil. 
Place that air fryer on your countertop and let the hot air fry your delicious delicacies without oil or grease. 
Don’t ever knock it until you have tried it. 
The circulation of the fan producing air hot enough to fry foods and lower cholesterol at the same time is a no-brainer for me! 
Some say that convection baking and air frying is the same thing, but I truly beg the differ, because if you bake, there’s bound to be sone grease somewhere in the 
baking pan, but when you air fry, there’s not grease to be seen and nice crispy fried foods to indulge in.
